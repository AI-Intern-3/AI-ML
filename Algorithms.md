List of common algorithms used for supervised learning:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
7. **Naive Bayes**
8. **Neural Networks (Multi-layer Perceptron)**
9. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**
10. **AdaBoost**
11. **XGBoost**
12. **LightGBM**
13. **CatBoost**

These algorithms cover a wide range of techniques used for both regression and classification tasks in supervised learning. Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific problem and dataset characteristics.
